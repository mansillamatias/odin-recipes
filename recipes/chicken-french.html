    <h1 id="header">Chef John's Chicken French</h1>

    <p>Chicken French has everything I love in a recipe. It's delicious and easy, frugal, yet fancy, and everyone loves it. Better yet, it has a vague, confusing history and completely preposterous name. This not-French recipe hails from the Rochester area of New York State, where it's a staple on virtually every Italian-American restaurant menu.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast cutlets, pounded flat</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
      <li>½ cup dry sherry</li>
      <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
      <li>¼ cup cold butter, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl. Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in another shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently press chicken into flour mixture to coat; shake off excess flour. Dip into egg mixture and coat completely.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter together in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir vegetable broth, sherry, and lemon juice in the same skillet; bring to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced by half. Remove from heat and add cold butter chunks; stir until butter is melted and sauce is shiny and thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir parsley into sauce and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken to the skillet over medium heat, spoon sauce over the top, and cook until chicken is heated through and no longer pink in the center, 1 to 3 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
