    <p>I made this up one night with ingredients I had on hand, and now it is a weekly request in our house! Everyone always asks for the recipe, and it is so simple. Serve it over a bed of mixed greens for a fancy presentation, or over pasta for a more traditional Italian feel!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese (Optional)</li>
      <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>6 thin chicken cutlets</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>6 sun-dried tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 ounces shaved Romano cheese (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 3/4 cup Romano cheese, bread crumbs, granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, and thyme in a shallow bowl. Press each chicken cutlet into the cheese mixture, turning to coat. Arrange chicken in a baking dish.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Bake chicken in the preheated oven until slightly golden, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, and minced garlic to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until bell pepper and tomatoes soften, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer baked chicken to a plate; top with bell pepper and tomato mixture. Garnish with shaved Romano cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
