    <h1 id="header">Broccoli Cheese Stuffed Chicken
</h1>

    <p>This cheesy broccoli chicken is the perfect comfort food on a cold day. By buying thin-sliced chicken cutlets, you save yourself the work of slicing them yourself, however feel free to cut regular-sized chicken breasts if you prefer. Slice in half horizontally, then pound thin to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Feel free to change up the flavor of The Laughing Cow® cheese for variety.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li>3 thin chicken breast cutlets</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 wedges spreadable garlic and herb cheese (such as The Laughing Cow®), softened</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen broccoli florets, thawed and finely chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>8 toothpicks, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pound chicken cutlets to 1/4-inch thickness between two pieces of plastic wrap. Sprinkle both sides of cutlets with salt and pepper. Set aside.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Mash cheese wedges with a fork in a small bowl and stir to a creamy consistency. Add broccoli and shredded Cheddar cheese and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread broccoli filling evenly over the middle of each cutlet. Start from one end, roll cutlets up and secure edges with toothpicks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour and paprika in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken rolls in the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken rolls into skillet and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over and brown the other side for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place skillet into the preheated oven and bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 14 to 16 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove toothpicks and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
