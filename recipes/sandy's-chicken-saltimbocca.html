    <h1 id="header">Sandy's Chicken Saltimbocca</h1>

    <p>Try this and you'll know why they call it saltimbocca--Italian for 'jump in your mouth.' It's kind of like it jumps right off of your plate. Though it's traditionally made with veal, I made it with chicken. Quick, easy, and so delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li>8 (6 ounce) chicken cutlets</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>16 large fresh sage leaves</li>
      <li>16 thin slices prosciutto</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>½ stick butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put 2 large (or 5 small) sage leaves on top of each cutlet, then wrap 2 slices of prosciutto crosswise around each cutlet, holding sage in place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
